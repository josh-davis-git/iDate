# iDate

 app for people to meet and date... ideally.
 currently the functionality exsits as i intended it to
 for a dating web app; the udemy course i built this application 
 using could have made it far more appealing which is what
 i hope to accomplish.
 
 i am going to completely update the look and feel. 
 The branch i will be woking from is cudtomize layout.
 
 if you have any suggestions feel free to fork or message me.
